A simple Michael Scott REST API that uses MySQL by defualt.
<br>
The data for the database is in the 'DATABASE' folder and should be placed in the 'data' folder within mysql. The login credentials are different in this version to restrict tampering of data due to the absence of authentication. <br> This is my first project done in Ruby as well as Ruby on Rails to gain experience in dealing with backend software development. I think I'm getting somewhat knowledgable about databases and this should reflect upon in my future projects.
